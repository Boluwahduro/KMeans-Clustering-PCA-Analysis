# KMeans-Clustering-PCA-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a dataset to identify underlying patterns and reduce dimensionality, respectively.
# Overview
The notebook begins with an exploration of categorical variables to determine the length of their unique labels. This initial step is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and preparing it for clustering and PCA.
# Key Features
Data Preparation: An essential step to format and prepare data for analysis.
KMeans Clustering: Utilizes the KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn to cluster the dataset into groups. The notebook includes a detailed example of generating example data, setting up a range of cluster numbers to try, and plotting the results to find the optimal number of clusters.
Elbow Method Visualization: A plot to determine the "elbow point" for selecting the appropriate number of clusters based on inertia, enhancing the decision-making process for clustering.
Correlation Matrix Analysis: Before applying PCA, a correlation matrix is generated to understand the relationships between variables.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Application of PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensionality while preserving as much information as possible. The notebook discusses the variance explained by each principal component.
# Getting Started
To get started with this notebook, you will need a Python environment set up with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Ensure you have installed the necessary packages like scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, and any other package mentioned in the notebook.
# Usage
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to understand the step-by-step process of performing KMeans clustering and PCA on your dataset. The notebook is well-commented to guide you through each step and decision point.
# Contributing
Contributions to improve the notebook are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests with enhancements, corrections, or additional examples.
